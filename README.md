objective : Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure.
# Network Security Assessment Project

## Overview
This project involves network security tasks including scanning local networks for open ports, analyzing packet captures, implementing DNS filtering, and demonstrating Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. The goal is to understand network exposure, identify security risks, and improve network defense strategies using practical tools and techniques.

## Project Structure
- Task 1: Local network scanning for open ports using Nmap.
- Task 2: Advanced scanning and network analysis. 
- Task 3: Packet capturing and analysis with Wireshark.
- Task 4: DNS filtering configuration and testing.
- Task 5: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack demonstration.
- Conclusion: Summary of findings and security recommendations.

## Tools and Technologies
- Nmap for network port scanning.
- Wireshark for network traffic capture and analysis.
- DNS filtering tools for traffic control.
- Linux/Unix command-line tools and scripting.

## How to Run
1. Install necessary tools: Nmap, Wireshark, and any DNS filtering software.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Follow specific instructions in each task folder to perform scans, capture packets, or run simulations.
4. Review output files, logs, and reports stored
